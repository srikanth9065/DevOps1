About the database
If you don't have a database named products.db in the database folder the backend won't work. Copy the products-template.db and rename the copy products.db before you start the server!

If you REALLY want to commit changes to the database, new tables etc, then make those changes in products-template.db and tell everyone in the team that the should copy it again and rename as described above
