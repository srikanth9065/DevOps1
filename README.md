Oskar, Srikanth, Tariq, Andreas and Jesper.

This webshop seemingly specializes in selling computer games. However, as a team of 100% DevOps, the main focus is of course CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment).

#### Branching 

There are edgecases and this document does not intent to turn a blind eye to that, rather see this strategy as a goal.

</div>

The branching strategy is as follows:
  ðŸ“£ The main branch is for code that is ready to go live and be deployed
  ðŸ“£ The dev branch is for code that is being currently being developed. 

Feature branches that are made for developing major and minor features. 

- Naming convention as follows, more specific rather than shorter.
feature-[*name_of_feature*]-[*creator*]

 Bugfix branches that are made for fixing bugs.
- Naming convention as follows, more specific rather than shorter.
hotfix/bugfix-[*bug*]-[*feature_related*]-[*creator*]

### CI/CD

test-deploy-dev.yml respectively test-deploy-main.yml contains GitHub Actions to run all tests and deploys to dev/prod server if passed. Write tests for your features please! (see [Contributing](#Contributing) for *slightly* more information)

development deployment online @ [https://dev.stackyield.net/](https://dev.stackyield.net/)
production deployment online @ [https://prod.stackyield.net/](https://prod.stackyield.net/)

For testing we use Jest, Postman/Newman, and WebdriverIO. Jest for frontend, Postman/newman for API and WebdriverIO for GUI testing. See their respective folders for whats going on.
